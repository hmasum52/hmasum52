<!--Hasan Masum ‚Äì Software Engineer and Research Enthusiast-->

Hello, I‚Äôm Hasan Masum, a recent graduate from the **[Department of CSE at BUET](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/)**, with a deep passion for **Software Engineering**. My journey in this field has been shaped by both my academic and professional experiences, leading me towards the goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in Software Engineering.   

My primary research interests lie in **automated Software Testing & Debugging**, **Cloud Native and Distributed Software Systems Design**, **application of AI/ML in Software Engineering**.

During my undergraduate studies, I undertook a thesis titled **‚ÄúTowards Intelligent Traffic Signaling in Dhaka City Based on Vehicle Detection and Congestion Optimization.‚Äù** This project allowed me to dive into **real-time video processing** and **YOLO-based object detection**, working on embedded systems like the **Raspberry Pi**. I also gained expertise in **multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II** and developed skills in resource optimization for low-resource environments. The significance of this work led me to submit my research to ACM SenSys 2024, where it is currently under review.  

Now, I am applying my skills in the software industry, with a particular focus on software engineering, especially **software testing**. Under the mentorship of [Proffesor Dr. Anindya Iqbal](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/anindyaiqbal), I am engaged in cutting-edge research on REST API testing using Large Language Models (LLMs). This work explores innovative approaches to enhance testing efficiency and accuracy, further broadening my expertise in this domain.  

Professionally, I am contributing as a Software Engineer - II at Pridesys IT, where we are developing a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software solution tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises. My role primarily involves backend development and DevOps -utilizing technologies such as Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, PostgreSQL and Azure Cloud, leveraging over 5 years of experience working on various projects and more than 1 year of professional experience.  

In addition to my core work, I am a passionate mobile app developer with 4 years of experience in Android development using Java. I have also ventured into cross-platform mobile app development with Flutter, expanding my versatility as a developer.

My journey into the world of web3 and blockchain began in 2022 with the Bangladesh Blockchain Olympiad, where I developed a project using Hyperledger Fabric. This sparked my enthusiasm for web3, leading me to gain experience with Ethereum, Solidity, Remix, and Hardhat. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to win prizes in hackathons, even against professional teams, and to organize a web3 hackathon, collaborating with top developers in Bangladesh. My passion for web3 continues to grow, and I am actively seeking opportunities to work in this transformative field.
